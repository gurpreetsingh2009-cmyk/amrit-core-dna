# amrit-core-dna

A comprehensive learning and analysis platform for Amrit Core DNA systems and operations.

## Overview
This repository contains core DNA learning modules, analysis tools, and experimental notebooks for understanding and implementing Amrit Core functionality. It provides a structured framework for learning layer implementation and data analysis.

## Features
- Core DNA learning layer implementation
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Python 3.10+ compatibility

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip or conda package manager

### Setup
